There were no grammar errors noted from the student's sentences tonight. So here is an additional learning: A crossbreed or crossbred usually refers to an animal with purebred parents of two different breeds, varieties, or populations. Crossbreeding, sometimes called "designer crossbreeding", refers to the process of breeding such an animal, often with the intention to create offspring that share the traits of both parent lineages, or producing an animal with hybrid vigor. While crossbreeding is used to maintain health and viability of animals, irresponsible crossbreeding can also produce animals of inferior quality or dilute a purebred gene pool to the point of extinction of a given breed of animal.

Nice work on being able to communicate effectively during our class. You responded well to my questions an gave meaningful insights using complex sentences. My comment for you is that you have a tendency to confuse word usage and word forms. I think New Concept English 3 and 4 will be a good lesson for you so you can learn more about the advanced grammar structures and verb tenses. Also, try mixing it up with a free talk class or an IELTS speaking practice because I think a student like you should spend some time answering critical questions.
